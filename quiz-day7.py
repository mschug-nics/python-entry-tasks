# Python Quiz 1
# Intro to CompSci
#
# (0.) The most important skill for a computer scientist is:


#
# (1.) Consider the following code. How can we make these values into a list?
# Answer by defining a list below called mylist.
a = 5
b = 7
c = 3
d = 2
### Your code starts here. ###

### Your code ends here.   ###
#
# (2.) Define a function that takes two variables (a and b) as input and
# multiplies them together. Call your function mymultiply.
### Your code starts here. ###




### Your code ends here.   ###
#
# (3.) Write the python code to ask the user for their name, and store
# what they type in a variable called 'name'.
### Your code starts here. ###




### Your code ends here.   ###
#
# (4.) Write an if-statement that tells the user their name is too long if
# it is longer than 5 characters. (HINT: use len() to get the length of
# their name)
### Your code starts here. ###




### Your code ends here.   ###
#
# (5.) Write a for-loop that prints out each element of mylist (from
# question 1).
### Your code starts here. ###




### Your code ends here.   ###
#
# (6.) Correct the following code that should add up the numbers in mylist.
#
mysum = 0
for i in mylist:
    mysum = mysum+1






# (7.) True or False.
#
# _____ a.) mylist[3]==3               
# _____ b.) (3<4) and len(mylist) != 4 
# _____ c.) (2**4)*4 >= 32             
# _____ d.) 3 < 4                      
# _____ e.) (4 < 3) or (4//2 >= 3)    

# (8.) Match.
#
# ___ a.) Problem solving            0.) A step-by-step solution to a problem
# ___ b.) Algorithms                 1.) Read Evaluate Print Loop
# ___ c.) REPL                       2.) converts a program to machine code
# ___ d.) interpreter                3.) The most import skill for a C.S.
# ___ e.) compiler                   4.) Python
# ___ f.) >>>                        5.) The Python prompt
# ___ g.) source code                6.) statements in a computer language
# ___ h.) high-level language        7.) executes a high-level program
# ___ i.) low-level language         8.) C
# ___ j.) the language we are using  9.) Java/Python/LISP/FORTRAN/COBOL
#
# (9.) Name that conditional operator.
#
# _____ a.) Less than
# _____ b.) Greater than
# _____ c.) Equal to
# _____ d.) Greater than or equal to
# _____ e.) Less than or equal to
# _____ f.) Not equal to
#
# (10.)
#
# Label each truth table with the appropriate logic operator.
#
# a.)
